- **Location and modern amenities** command substantial premiums
- **Multiple regression** explains 2.4x more variance than simple regression

## 💬 Interview Q&A (Conceptual Understanding)

### 1. What assumptions does linear regression make?
Linear regression makes several key assumptions:
- **Linearity**: Relationship between features and target is linear
- **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other
- **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of residuals (equal spread)
- **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed
- **No Multicollinearity**: Features are not highly correlated with each other

*In our housing analysis*: We validated these through residual plots, Q-Q plots, and VIF analysis (all values < 2.0).

### 2. How do you interpret the coefficients?
Each coefficient represents the **change in target variable for a unit change in that feature**, holding all other variables constant. 

*In our housing model*:
- **Bathrooms coefficient (+₹1,097,117)**: Adding one bathroom increases house price by ₹1.1M
- **Area coefficient (+₹235.85)**: Each additional sq ft increases price by ₹236
- **AC coefficient (+₹785,551)**: Having AC increases property value by ₹785K

### 3. What is R² score and its significance?
**R² (R-squared)** measures the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model. Range: 0 to 1 (0% to 100%).

*Our results*:
- **Simple Regression R² = 27.29%**: Area alone explains 27% of price variation
- **Multiple Regression R² = 64.95%**: All features together explain 65% of price variation
- **Significance**: Higher R² indicates better model fit and predictive power

### 4. When would you prefer MSE over MAE?
**MSE (Mean Squared Error)** vs **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**:
- **Use MSE when**: Large errors are disproportionately bad (penalizes outliers heavily)
- **Use MAE when**: All errors are equally important (robust to outliers)

*In our housing analysis*:
- **MSE = 1.77×10¹²**: Heavily penalizes large price prediction errors
- **MAE = ₹979,680**: Average absolute error, more interpretable for business
- **Preference**: MSE for model training (gradient-friendly), MAE for business interpretation

### 5. How do you detect multicollinearity?
**Detection methods**:
- **Correlation Matrix**: Check pairwise correlations (>0.8 indicates high correlation)
- **VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)**: VIF > 5-10 indicates multicollinearity
- **Condition Number**: High values (>30) suggest multicollinearity

*Our analysis results*:
- **VIF values**: All features < 2.0 (excellent - no multicollinearity)
- **Correlation matrix**: Highest correlation between features was moderate
- **Conclusion**: Coefficients are stable and reliable

### 6. What is the difference between simple and multiple regression?
| Aspect | Simple Linear Regression | Multiple Linear Regression |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Variables** | One predictor (x) | Multiple predictors (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) |
| **Equation** | y = β₀ + β₁x + ε | y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε |
| **R² (Our Results)** | 27.29% | 64.95% |
| **Interpretation** | Direct relationship | Considers multiple factors simultaneously |
| **Use Case** | Simple relationships | Complex real-world scenarios |

### 7. Can linear regression be used for classification?
**Technically possible but not recommended**:
- **Issues**: Outputs continuous values, not probabilities
- **Problems**: Can predict values outside 0-1 range
- **Better alternatives**: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees

**However**: Linear regression can be adapted:
- **Threshold approach**: Use 0.5 cutoff for binary classification
- **Feature engineering**: Create binary outcomes from continuous predictions
- **Our housing context**: Could classify "Expensive" vs "Affordable" housing

### 8. What happens if you violate regression assumptions?
**Consequences of assumption violations**:

| Assumption Violated | Consequences | Solutions |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Linearity** | Biased predictions, poor fit | Transform variables, polynomial features |
| **Independence** | Incorrect standard errors | Time series analysis, clustered errors |
| **Homoscedasticity** | Unreliable confidence intervals | Weighted regression, log transformation |
| **Normality** | Invalid hypothesis tests | Large samples (CLT), non-parametric methods |
| **No Multicollinearity** | Unstable coefficients | Remove correlated features, PCA, Ridge regression |

*In our analysis*: We checked all assumptions and found reasonable compliance, making our model reliable for housing price prediction.

## 📊 Model Diagnostics

### Residual Analysis Results
- **Residuals distribution**: Approximately normal with slight right skew
- **Homoscedasticity**: Reasonable constant variance assumption met
- **No obvious patterns**: In residual plots, indicating good model fit

### Statistical Validation
- **VIF Analysis**: All values < 2.0 (low multicollinearity)
- **Coefficient Significance**: All major features show meaningful impact
- **Model Stability**: Consistent performance across train-test splits

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- **Polynomial Features**: Capture non-linear relationships
- **Interaction Terms**: Model feature combinations (area × amenities)
- **Regularization**: Ridge/Lasso regression for feature selection
- **External Data**: Add neighborhood, economic, and temporal factors

## 📚 Final Note
Linear regression provides an excellent foundation for understanding **predictive modeling** and **feature relationships**. This analysis demonstrates how multiple features significantly improve prediction accuracy and provide actionable business insights for real estate decision-making.

**Key Takeaway**: While area is the strongest individual predictor, the combination of location, amenities, and structural features creates a comprehensive model that explains nearly 65% of housing price variation.
